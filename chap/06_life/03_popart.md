Today, I went to Andy Warhol Museum in downtown. Andy is an pop artist, and his work includes paintings, photographies, screen printings, etc. He is also the guy who paints the famous Marilyn Monroe. Actually, his works and American pop culture are new to me. I feel that the color is too vivid for me, but also found it is pretty representive for American culture.

The old lady talked with me for a little while. She said that she admire traditional Chinese culture since that teaches people how to respect each others, and there’s no such thing in American culture. I think she is right. We meet different cultures, and we should also learn from different cultures.
