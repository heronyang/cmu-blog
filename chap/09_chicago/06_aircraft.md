## Real Aircraft in Museum

*Day 13*

1992, one United Boeing 727 aircraft was towed across Lake Michigan and over Lake Shore Drive to Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Nowadays, visitors can see a real size aircraft hanging inside of the museum. Most amazing part was the cockpit, where I can see all the control panels.

Today was short, I went to Apple Store to get my phone fixed, then went Museum of Science and Industry. Rest of the time I was walking around the city or working. Visiting Apple Store in United States is always cool. For my case, they plunged the power in my phone, then connect to my phone wirelessly. Then, the guy ran a diagnose test on his iPad to find out the problems of my phone. Last, by following his instruction, my phone got fixed within half an hour.
