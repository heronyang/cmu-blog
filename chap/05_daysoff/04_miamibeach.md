## Miami Beach

*Spring Break Day 4*

Today was more relaxing comparing to previous days. We took monorail to Miami downtown from our hotel, and then took a water taxi to Miami Beach. Then, after the dinner, we headed back to our hotel. I found high percentage of people speak Spanish here, and they may only know a little English.
