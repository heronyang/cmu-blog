## About Me

<!--![Heron Yang](../../images/me.jpg) -->

Hi, I'm Heron.

My life is about programming, blogging and photography since my life goal is to **create something people want**, which I keep reminding myself.

I believe that everyone should has his or her own dream, and we all work hard to make it come true. To create the things I want, I travel, I observe, I talk to people, and I stick to my original indentations.

By wearing a black t-shirt with jeans everyday, people always find it easy to recognize me from the crowd (also because of my hair style). Last, I appreciate every single person I met within my life journey for being amazing.
